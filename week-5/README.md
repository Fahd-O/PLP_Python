# Week 5 Assignment: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  

## 📘 Overview
This folder contains my Week 5 assignment for the PLP SE Program, Python Module.
This assignment explores **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python by applying concepts such as **classes, attributes, methods, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation**.  

---

## 📌 Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class  
1. Create a class representing an object (e.g., Smartphone, Book, etc.).  
2. Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life.  
3. Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.  
4. Add an inheritance layer to explore **polymorphism** or **encapsulation**.  

---

## 📌 Assignment 2: Polymorphism Challenge  
- Create a program that includes **animals or vehicles** with the same action method `move()`.  
- Each class should define `move()` differently. Example:  
  - `Car.move()` → prints `"Driving 🚗"`  
  - `Plane.move()` → prints `"Flying ✈️"`  

---

## 🏁 Outcomes  
By completing this assignment, I:  
- Understand how to design Python classes.  
- Practice initializing objects with constructors.  
- Learn **inheritance** and **method overriding**.  
- Gain hands-on experience with **polymorphism** in Python.
