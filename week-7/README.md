# Week 7 — Iris Dataset Analysis (PLP — Python)

**Project**  
Analysis and visualization of the *Iris* dataset using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`, `pandas`, `numpy` and `matplotlib`.  
This submission is a Python-script-based deliverable prepared for Week 7 assignment of the PLP Software Engineering course, Python module.

## Brief description / objective
- Load the Iris dataset (via `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`), inspect and clean it (if needed).  
- Perform basic statistical analysis and groupings by species.  
- Produce **four visualizations** required by the assignment:
  - **Line chart (trend proxy)** — cumulative mean of sepal length across sample order (Iris has no time column; cumulative mean is used as a documented trend proxy).
  - **Bar chart** — average petal length per species (annotated).
  - **Histogram** — distribution of sepal length.
  - **Scatter plot** — sepal length vs petal length, colored by species.
- Save all terminal outputs to `analysis_output.txt` for easy reference.

Notes on intentional uniqueness:
- Small derived features were added (`sepal_area`, `petal_area`) for additional insight.
- The trend requirement is satisfied with a documented cumulative-mean line chart (explicitly explained in outputs).
- Bar chart includes annotated values for clarity.

## How to run
1. Open the repo folder in VS Code GitBash terminal and create / activate a venv:

    **Git Bash**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/Scripts/activate
    ```

2. Install required packages:

    ```bash
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    python -m pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python week7_iris_analysis.py
    ```

4. After successful run you will find:
- week7_iris_clean.csv — cleaned dataset for submission.

- analysis_output.txt — saved terminal output (exploration, stats, findings).

- plots/ — four PNG files (line, bar, histogram, scatter).

## Notes

- The line chart uses a cumulative mean over sample order as a documented "trend" proxy because Iris has no temporal field — this is explained in the script outputs.

- The script includes simple, robust error messaging (if packages are missing or an exception occurs).
