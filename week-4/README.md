# 📂 Week 4 Assignment: File Handling & Error Management in Python

## 📘 Overview
This folder contains my Week 4 assignment for the PLP SE Program Python Module.
This week’s assignment focuses on **File Handling** and **Error Handling** in Python.  
I learnt how to read from files, write to files, and handle unexpected issues gracefully using `try-except` blocks.

## 📝 Tasks

### 1. File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️
- Create a program that:
  - Reads the contents of a file.
  - Modifies the content
  - Writes the modified version to a new file.

### 2. Error Handling Lab 🧪
- Create a program that:
  - Asks the user to enter a filename.
  - Attempts to open the file.
  - If the file doesn’t exist or can’t be read, displays a **friendly error message** instead of crashing.

## ✅ Expected Outcomes
By completing this assignment, I am able to:
- Efficiently **read from and write to files** in Python.
- Use **exception handling** to write more robust and error-resistant programs.
- Develop a foundation for building real-world applications that manage files safely.
